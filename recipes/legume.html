<img src="https://m.haitiopen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Haitian-Legume-Recipes.png" alt="A bowl of freshly made Legume">
<p>​Legume is probably one of the most labor intensive Haitian meals out there.
 It consists of some form of protein like beef that gets mixed together with a variety of vegetables that are mashed. 
As with any type of Haitian dish, legume has several different variations. 
It can be made with beef, chicken, turkey, shrimp, crabs, conch, pork, or a combination of any of the above. </p>
<p>Although the vegetables can be variable,
it HAS to include these key ingredients: “militon” (chayote), “berejenn” (eggplants), spinach and carrots. 
Other vegetables that can be used but not mandatory is cabbage, collard greens, 
green papaya, green beans, and mixed vegetables, just to name a few. </p>
